# Impossible to Click Button

A fun JavaScript project where the button moves away when you try to click it â€” making it "impossible" to click!

## How it works

- The button detects the mouse position.
- If the mouse gets too close, the button jumps to a random position on the screen.

## How to run

Open `index.html` in any modern browser to try it out.

## Tech stack

- HTML
- CSS (inline styles)
- JavaScript
